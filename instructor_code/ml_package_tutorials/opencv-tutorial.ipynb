    "# Tutorial for OpenCV\n",
    "OpenCV is a library for processing images with computer vision algorithms.  Like pandas and numpy, it is extremely important for machine learning, particularly for computer vision.  OpenCV is written primariily in C++, but there are Python wrappers for it that enable for the code to be processed as though it were written in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the OpenCV array structures are converted to-and-from Numpy arrays. So whatever operations you can do in Numpy, you can combine it with OpenCV.  This makes OpenCV and Numpy extremely useful when used together.  Typically, **OpenCV** is used for loading/saving images, as well as for complex image manipulation (such as detecting objects in images), while **Numpy** is more often used for matrix-like image manipulations, such as rotating or cropping an image. \n",
