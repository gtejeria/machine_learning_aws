# AWS for Machine Learning
This repository has a backup of the students' work from the class for the students to view. Each student's code is backed up to student_code/USERNAME, where the USERNAME is everything that comes before the "@" in the student's email address, with any non-english a-z characters deleted, and all characters lowercased. For example, éstuianté!@example.com would find her code under `student_copes/stdudiant`.
The instructor's version of the code is found under `instructor_code/`

This repository also has our infrastructure for setting up EC2 machines each day.


## Jupyter Notebooks for Machine Learning
One of the primary purposes of this repository is to maintain a persistent state for our interactive teaching code base, which includes both template and student-edited Jupyter notebooks.  Instructions for accessing template Jupyter notebooks, student Jupyter notebooks, and data are each discussed individually below:

1. **Jupyter Notebook under `instructor_code`**: These are template for the student to modify.
2. **Jupyter Notebook Files for Students**: We will copy the template notebooks from `instructor_code` to a location where the students can use it every day. For now, the location is `machine_learning_aws/daily_use`, though this location may change as we continue the development of this repository.
3. **Data for Students**: Data for this course can be found on the EC2 instances under the `machine_learning_aws/data/` sub-directory in the `machine_learning_aws/` repository, or through the absolute path `/home/ubuntu/machine_learning_aws/data/`.


## Installing and Configuring Conda Environment on EC2 Instances: Ubuntu AMI
Our daily login/setup instructions are still changing, as we are still developing this code to make it simpler to use and more reliable.
We will post instructions shortly on how to log in to the EC2 instances, and how to set up your environment on your own computer.

Thank you to the MIT GSL and Amazon AWS Educate teams for providing us with Amazon computing resources for this course.
